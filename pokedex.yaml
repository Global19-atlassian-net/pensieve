  - title: Changing Wifi credentials on a 2.x device
    Issue: >-
      Users sometimes ask us to change wifi settings on a production device
      (maybe even remote device). Should direct them to [our
      docs](https://docs.resin.io/deployment/network/2.0.0/#changing-the-network-at-runtime)
      where there's some scripts to do it as self-service using NetworkManager
      over dbus using Python. But that's not always an option, and if we need to
      change network settings, it's good to know how.
    Solution: >-
      Log into the device. The rest of the work will be through `nmcli`, the
      NetworkManager command line interface (see more in [their
      docs](https://developer.gnome.org/NetworkManager/stable/nmcli.html):


      * run `nmcli` on its own to show all interfaces and what connections they
      have, or `nmcli c` for a connection summary, where all connection files
      known to NM are listed, with the connected ones highlighted

      * If there's already a wifi interface, the best is to clone it into a new
      one:


      ```

      nmcli c clone resin-wifi resin-wifi2

      nmcli c modify resin-wifi2 wifi.ssid NEWSSID wifi-sec.psk NEWPASSWORD

      ```

      This will set up a new connection. You can use `nmcli c up resin-wifi2` to
      try to connect to it then (will likely break you current connection, if
      everything goes well). If need to remove old connections, don't forget not
      just removing with `nmcli c delete <CONNECTIONNAME>`, but also from
      `/mnt/boot/system-connections` too, otherwise it will be copied back from
      there on the next boot.

    Name: Bulbasaur
    Height: 0.7

    Description: >-
      Bulbasaur can be seen napping in bright sunlight. There is a seed on its
      back. By soaking up the sun's rays, the seed grows progressively larger.


      __Note:__ replace `CHANGE_ME` with a unique string. You can generate one
      by running:

      ```

      openssl rand -hex 32

      ```

      In the canned response, add the output of `openssl rand -hex 32` as
      `CHANGE_ME`


      **Canned response:**

      >By choosing to enable two-factor authentication, you have made it clear
      to us that security is as an important concern for you as it is for us. It
      also means you do not completely trust authenticating with just a
      password.


      >Therefore you will understand that we need to take extra measures to be
      sure that we are not disabling two-factor authentication for an attacker
      who learned your password.


      >We would like to verify that you're in possession of the SSH key you have
      provided to us. To do this you'll have to run the following command and
      send us the output from the email account associated with your resin
      account, to support@resin.com. After we validate the signature we'll
      disable 2FA on your account and you'll be able to login with just your
      password.

      ```

      echo CHANGE_ME | openssl rsautl -sign -inkey ~/.ssh/id_rsa | base64

      ```

      >If the command doesn't work, it may be that your SSH keys are stored
      elsewhere, you can edit the command to point to where your SSH keys are.
      Please let us know if you have trouble with these instructions.


      **Verifying Users Response via SSH Challenge**

      __Note:__ You'll need a GNU version of openssl to run this.


      1. Go to their ssh key tab in preferences
      https://dashboard.resin.io/preferences?tab=sshkeys

      2. For each key, copypasta into a local file with a name like
      `userskey.pub`.

      Open Terminal, run file as:

      ```

      ssh-keygen -f userskey.pub -e -m pem > userskey.pem

      ```


      In Finder, there's a new file called userskey.pem.


      3. Next, you have to convert that to a PEM encoded (plain? not sure what
      this format is called) public key using this command:

      ```

      openssl rsa -in userskey.pem -RSAPublicKey_in -pubout > userskey.plain.pem

      ```

      4. Now you're ready to verify whatever the user sent you

      Say they sent you this response:

      ```

      o7+ga4dl8cNB+O/9kxvEZj6UP5r3Tx3bno1ukYNdBd/hd0zNk7y153qxHfj9MOlmG6+VuaqXLZmJ

      8rEOUjsGxqq377SSV9OEs0PkvvVhKyjtYxb3Vm2apJLal9Mfhktr/QW3pht1kX4XgZmzo8CcbL5q

      5EWMVVuXttSbjcZY2hDB3lYU9OElggkOxKNO/jug9X0mOc6XeUM7+aSd12LDHTydpgQ0MZxgNfHv

      KQnkCHcP50rbIqnhcbjBFzeOWFcAVcpKCuUumnKuQv7k2SRjUEIIZEXVWqiXAeEl2jpblYsDUmKV

      jQLi+rLohLBZDlsBxtQuxBYK4NVhnj01wzkThw==

      ```

      You put this in a file, say `response.base64` and then do:

      ```

      cat response.base64 | base64 -d | openssl rsautl -verify -inkey
      userskey.plain.pem -pubin

      ```

      This should print the original random challenge you sent him. i.e if you
      sent `echo foobarfoobar`, then the above command should print
      `foobarfoobar`


      If the user's key doesn't match, you'll see

      They may have another SSH key to try.

      If not, it means we don't have a unique way to confirm the account. Here's
      a potential canned response that ensures the user knows why we can't
      disable 2FA and hopefully reduces frustration.


      > At Resin we believe that security is one of the cornerstones of a
      reliable service. As such, we need to be absolutely sure that in cases
      where users have mislaid their credentials we can authenticate them using
      other means.

      >

      > Where Two Factor Authentication (2FA) is involved, we need to ensure
      that the account does belong to you. To allow us to do this we ask you to
      sign a unique passphrase with the private key associated with your
      account; this enables us to validate your ownership of the account.

      >

      > Unfortunately, in this case, without the ability to verify your
      ownership we cannot disable 2FA for the account.

      >

      > However, there is nothing stopping (and we actively encourage!) you to
      create a new account to continue using the Resin service.

      >

      > Thank you for your understanding, and please let us know if we may
      assist you any further.


      If the key does match, and there's reason to believe that the computer is
      compromised, the next challenge is to ask the user to confirm private
      information about their account.

      >Thank you for sending the key. We think it's prudent to ask you one more
      security question. Please reply with both the name and device type for an
      application associated with your account.


      If the key does match, and there's no reason to believe the computer is
      compromised, 2FA can be disabled. (Currently, this requires directly
      editing the database. Petros or Page are the only ones who can do this.)

      >Thank you for confirming. I've disabled two-factor authentication for
      your account.

      **How to use one-wire temperature sensor:**

      Add:

      ```

      dtoverlay=w1-gpio

      ```

      to `/boot/config.txt`

      See https://resin.io/blog/updating-config-txt-remotely/ on how to do that.


      The container should also `modprobe w1-gpio && modprobe w1-therm`. Then
      the temperature probe should show up under `/sys/bus/w1/devices`

      If you are using an admin account, you gain access to all devices and

      limited to only gain read access to devices and applications that are open
      for support. The customer can open a device for support in the UI.  The
      process for this, and the canned response to send the user is found here:

      Until we transition all support agents to the `support agent` role, we
      need a way for an admin account to check if a device or an application is
      open for support. This can be done with the following commands:
