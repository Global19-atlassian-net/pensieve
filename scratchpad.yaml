  Entry 1: Issues with Line Endings
    Signs and Symptoms: Line endings differ between windows and the unix-y world (they used to be different again for mac but not for many years), which can result in issues. E.g. a user seeing something like:
`/usr/src/app/run.sh: line 2: $'\r': command not found`
    Treatments: To resolve this, the user needs to configure git to auto convert line endings. Point them at https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings/#platform-windows.
