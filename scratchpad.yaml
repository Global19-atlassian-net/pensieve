      Docker might be failing to create a network bridge at startup.


      You might see the following logs:


      ```

      Error starting daemon: Error initializing network controller: Error
      creating default "bridge" network: failed to allocate gateway (X.X.X.X):
      Address already in use

      ```

      Or this:

      ```

      Error starting daemon: Error initializing network controller: error
      obtaining controller instance: failed to get bridge network configurations
      from store: error while populating kmap: meta1 error: checksum error

      ```


      In order to fix it, delete the network files:


      ```sh

      rm -rf /var/lib/docker/network/files/*

      ```


      Start docker:


      ```sh

      systemctl start docker

      ```


      Start the supervisor:


      ```sh

      systemctl start resin-supervisor

      ```

  Issues with Line Endings:
    Signs and Symptoms: "Line endings differ between windows and the unix-y world (they used to be different again for mac but not for many years), which can result in issues. E.g. a user seeing something like: `/usr/src/app/run.sh: line 2: $'\r': command not found`"
    Treatments: >-
      To resolve this, the user needs to configure git to auto convert line
      endings. Point them at
