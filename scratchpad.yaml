  Docker won't start: 
    TEST: FOOBAR

      Docker might be failing to create a network bridge at startup.

      You might see the following logs:

      ```
      Error starting daemon: Error initializing network controller: Error creating default "bridge" network: failed to allocate gateway (X.X.X.X): Address already in use
      ```
      Or this:
      ```
      Error starting daemon: Error initializing network controller: error obtaining controller instance: failed to get bridge network configurations from store: error while populating kmap: meta1 error: checksum error
      ```

      In order to fix it, delete the network files:

      ```sh
      rm -rf /var/lib/docker/network/files/*
      ```

      Start docker:

      ```sh
      systemctl start docker
      ```

      Start the supervisor:

      ```sh
      systemctl start resin-supervisor
      ```

  Issues with Line Endings:
    Signs and Symptoms: "Line endings differ between windows and the unix-y world (they used to be different again for mac but not for many years), which can result in issues. E.g. a user seeing something like: `/usr/src/app/run.sh: line 2: $'\r': command not found`"
    Treatments: "To resolve this, the user needs to configure git to auto convert line endings. Point them at https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings/#platform-windows."
